  InfoSection(title: "FAQs", content: '''
 1. What is Ayurveda?

Ayurveda is comprehensive medical system that is 5000 years old.
 It considers itself as the Mother of medicine, from which the Chinese as well as classical western medicine have issued. 
 The name comes from Sanskrit (Ayus - life, Veda - knowledge).
 It is considered as the oldest surviving treatment system in the world.

.

 2. What are the principles of Ayurveda?

 The essential principle of Ayurveda is life in compliance with one's constitution and with the laws of nature.
  Ayurveda is a holistic science; it concerns the whole human being.
   It does not aim at the suppression of symptoms but searches for and cures the cause of illness. 
   It directs itself to the maintenance of energy balance in the body, the most important condition for health.

Ayurveda is engaged in details not only in treatment but also in prevention of illness and longevity. 
The diet, exercise and the whole way of living is individually recommended according to the constitution, race and climatic conditions.
 The admission of individual distinctness and individual approach to treatment is one of the unique features of Ayurvedic medicine.

.

 3. Is Ayurvedic Medicine Effective?

 If the client follows all the directions from the ayurvedic practitioner, then yes,
  the client can generally expect the 1st shift of many shifts within 2-6 weeks.

.

 4. Why try Ayurveda?

 The history of Ayurveda goes back 5,000 years. At present there are more and more physicians from all over the world who are interested in it and who have adapted this medicinal system to our western society.
 Ayurveda and ayurvedic treatment techniques have been proven effective in many clinical studies.
 Ayurveda should be the first choice in case of chronic (drawn-out) illness, which can not be treated in a satisfactory manner by conventional medicine.
 Ayurveda aims not only to treat the sick person, but also to prevent illness in healthy people, who can get ill due to stress, family problems and so on. 
 Therefore it is not possible to call Ayurveda, the science of life, merely as alternative medicine.

.

 5. What are the differences between Ayurveda and western medicine?

Ayurveda does not stand against western medicine. In acute cases, the role of classical medicine is irreplaceable. In chronic illnesses, combination with Ayurveda can be beneficial, and in many chronic illnesses Ayurveda achieves excellent results even where classical medicine has failed.Ayurveda is strictly individual (the treatment is determined on the basis of given person's consti-tution and state of his/her health).
It aims at the elimination of causes, not the suppression of symptoms; during the treatment only natural remedies free of any side effects are used.
The cause of illness can be found in the inner imbalance as well as in the relation with the surrounding environment whereas western medicine considers, for instance, virus or bacteria as the main cause.

There can be a detox effect which can take the form of mild flu-like symptoms, or a rash. This usually is a normal reaction and means that the herbs are doing their job. Sometimes the reaction can be stronger and usually the practitioner makes an adjustment in the dosing.
 
 .

 6. Where does Ayurvedic medicine come from?

Nature! Ayurveda remedies are all based on the concept that you can eat your therapies. That is why there is such an emphasis on making sure that the herbs, oils, and other substances come from clean sources so that we don't create more toxins in the body.

.

7. Who created Ayurveda?

The sages of India receive the gift of Ayurveda was a gift from the Hindu gods at least 5000 yrs. ago. New research is showing that Ayurveda was alive and well 10,000 to 20,000 years ago.

.

8. Why is Ayurveda important?

Ayurveda treats the root cause of disease and allopathic methods treat symptoms. Ayurveda goes after the root cause which will have a more longstanding effect.

Ayurveda allows you to take the reins of your own health. You don't have to wait for a prescription or undergo unnecessary tests. For example, if you normally have a pattern of getting a little constipated in fall, then prior to fall you would start eating more warm cooked moderately spiced foods, ingest more healthy oils, take in more water and warm herbal teas, return to a more regular routine, avoid cold & drying foods.

.

9. What importance do herbs have?

Herbs are gentle and natural treatment. They do not have any side effects, because they are compatible with the body's own chemicals. They are absorbed easily and because of their different characteristics (desiccant/humid, incentive/sedative etc.) it is possible to choose exactly the right herbs which can cure in the given case depending on the illness.

.

10. What is the importance of food in Ayurveda?

According to Ayurveda up to 70 % of illnesses can be influenced by correct diet. A maximally satisfying diet that leads the organism to balance can be designed in compliance with the constitution. Ayurveda does not forcibly forbid any food, nor does it incline to any artificial unnatural diet, but rather in each group (fruit, vegetables, meat, cereals and dairy products) there are certain foodstuffs that are more appropriate and others less so. 
Properly chosen food, through its own quality, has a curative influence on particular organs.

.

11. What are the main treatment techniques?

Ayurveda offers a treatment for each of the five senses: herbs and nutrition act on the sense of the taste, the olfactory sense is influenced by aromatherapy, the touch is related to Yoga, precious stones and massages, the hearing is treated by mantra (sound energy with curative effect) and we can affect the sight by colours (colour-therapy).

Ayurveda mostly proves successful in the treatment of chronic illnesses. Ayurveda covers and cures a wide range of illnesses, from the common cold to chronic illnesses, allergy, chronic fatigue, ulcers, bad digestion, from insomnia to grave mental disorders. The choice of relevant therapy depends on the individual constitution, on the type of imbalance and on the season. The following are the most frequently used treatment techniques:

aromatherapy including the use of aromatic oils and incense sticks

herbal treatment using natural substances without side effects

special breathing exercises carried out before meditation

choice of appropriate exercises contributes to the whole health

the detoxication method called Panchakarma cleans the organism and eliminates the settlement of toxic substances

shirodhara with its deep calming effect,

alimentation and contingent change of diet belong to the most important measures to keep or recovering health. Agni, the fire of digestion, operates in the stomach; it is responsible for correct and perfect digestion. 
To a large extent our health is dependent not only on the kind of food but also on the amount of food we eat and when we eat it. An improperly set-up meal, eaten at an inconvenient time or eaten in a haste-
all of these factors contribute to our imbalance and disease

meditation influences positively our mind and thus the entire organism

marma therapy stimulates by gentle massage some points on the body and reflexively affects the respective organs

yoga - special exercises called “Asany” belong to the part of treatment of many illnesses. Hathayoga is the nearest to Ayurveda,

therapy by colours and stones.
