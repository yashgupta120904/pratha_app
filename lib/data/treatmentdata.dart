.

What are the symptoms of skin problems?

Symptoms of skin problems vary significantly, depending on what condition you have been facing. Skin changes are not always due to skin problems as is believed in most cases.
For example, you may get a blister from wearing ill-fitting shoes. However, when skin changes show up with no known cause, they may be linked to a hidden condition not to be ignored.

Generally, skin problems may cause:

•  Scaly or rough skin.

.

How is a skin problem diagnosed?

Often, one of our doctors can diagnose a skin problem by visually examining your skin over the video or pictures taken by you with a skin test if required.
If looking at your skin doesn't provide clear answers, your provider may use tests such as:

•  Biopsy, removing a small piece of skin to examine under a microscope.
•  Culture, taking a skin sample to test for bacteria, fungus or viruses.
•  Skin patch test, applying small amounts of substances to test for allergic reactions.
•  Black light examination (Wood light test), using an ultraviolet (UV) light to view your skin's pigment more clearly.
•  Diascopy, pressing a microscope slide against a skin patch to see if the skin changes color.

•  Tzanck test, examining the fluid from a blister to check for herpes simplex or herpes zoster...

.

Which are the best Ayurvedic treatments for your skin type?

Ayurvedic treatments depend on all of these factors. Under this system, you'll need to make adjustments to your lifestyle, diet, stress, and exercise in order to promote healthy skin free of any problems. This is done under a strict guidance of the doctors at Pratha Ayurveda. 
Part of Ayurvedic skin care is also a routine that addresses your dominant dosha. This is much like Western medicine, where you use varied products for your skin type. 

Vata skin tends to be dry and age quickly, so you should use:

•  Nourishing products
•  Hydrating products
•  Anti-aging products
•  Warm oil massage
•  Natural moisturizers

.

Pitta skin is sensitive to the sun and tends to have moles and freckles. You should:

•  Protect your skin from the sun.
•  Avoid tanning.
•  Avoid over-exfoliating.
•  Avoid hot water and steams. 
•  Use a facial oil daily.

.

Kapha skin is normal, clear, and balanced skin, though it can also be oily. To keep kapha skin healthy:

•  Use a warm oil massage daily.
•  Cleanse with a gentle exfoliant.

.

Which Ayurvedic Herb Is Good for Skin?

Essential oils, facial oils, herbal extracts, and fruit extracts are a big part of keeping skin healthy and away from any kind of skin problems. Herbs and oils are used in different ways, which also include the following:
Anti-aging. Ayurvedic anti-aging products have specific ingredients to help nourish the skin and promote youthfulness. These often include:

•  Gotu kola, which can help your skin make collagen
•  Indian gooseberry, which is rich in vitamin C 

You would find a range of such anti-aging products on the Pratha Ayurveda shop many of which are OTC products. However, to get the most out them you are recommended to consult one of our doctors initially.

Brightening. Glowing skin is considered healthy and youthful in Ayurveda. Use plants that can brighten the skin and remove ama (toxins) or metabolic waste buildup in the skin. These include:

•  Vetiver
•  Sandalwood
•  Indian madder
•  Indian sarsaparilla
•  Gotu kola

.

Anti-inflammatory. Environmental pollution, sunlight, chemicals, stress, and allergens can all cause inflammation in your skin. Using anti-inflammatory herbs can help protect your skin. Some of the well known and common herbs include:

•  Aloe vera
•  Frankincense
•  Silk cotton tree
•  Rose

.

Wound healing. Gotu kola is also commonly used to heal wounds and may help eczema, psoriasis, and scars.

.

Considerations

While herbal extracts in skin creams and oils are likely safe and effective, studies show that lots of Ayurvedic benefits and herbal supplements are accompanied by high amounts of heavy metals. 

Herbal supplements can interact with your medications and aren't always safe for everyone. Don't take herbs if you're pregnant or nursing, are on medications, have ongoing health problems, or are an older adult. Talk to our doctor at Pratha Ayurveda first.
Self medication usually harmful if taken without ny professional knowledge.

.

Hair Fall Reasons

Because hairs continue to enter the resting phase and then fall out, we are constantly having hair fall. A healthy adult may lose about 70 to 100 hairs on their head per day. But because new hairs are always growing and replacing them, this natural hair fall isn’t noticeable.

The rate of hair fall may increase noticeably if the hair roots are damaged during the growth phase or if a lot of hairs go into the resting phase at the same time. If no new hair grows and replaces the hair, that part of the skin becomes bald. This type of hair fall is referred to as alopecia – regardless of how large the bald spot is or whether it affects the scalp or body hair. In some types of alopecia, the hair may grow back. But baldness can also be permanent – one typical example is gradual hair fall in men (male pattern hair fall).

.

Let's start with the basics

For many people, hair is a natural part of their look and an expression of their personality. Hair can also offer protection: For instance, it helps to keep the sun’s rays from reaching our scalp. Eyelashes and eyebrows keep dust, dirt and sweat out of our eyes. Even the hairs in our nose and ears help to keep out germs and other foreign objects. Body hair helps to regulate our body temperature: The hairs stand up when it’s cold, keeping the air that is warmed by the body close to the body – like a warming layer of air.

.

Hair structure

Each hair has a hair shaft and a hair root. The shaft is the visible part of the hair that sticks out of the skin. The hair root is in the skin and extends down to the deeper layers of the skin. It is surrounded by the hair follicle (a sheath of skin and connective tissue), which is also connected to a sebaceous gland.

Each hair follicle is attached to a tiny muscle (arrector pili) that can make the hair stand up. Many nerves end at the hair follicle too. These nerves sense hair movement and are sensitive to even the slightest draft.

At the base of the hair, the hair root widens to a round hair bulb. The hair papilla, which supplies the hair root with blood, is found inside the bottom of the hair bulb. New hair cells are constantly being made in the hair bulb, close to the papilla.

.

How does hair grow?

New cells are constantly forming in the hair bulb. These cells stick together and harden. The full strand of hair develops from this group of hardened hair cells. Because new hardened cells keep on attaching to the hair from below, it is gradually pushed up out of the skin. In this way, a single hair on your head grows at a rate of about 1 cm per month. Facial hair, and especially eyelashes, eyebrows and body hair grows at a slower pace.

Whether it is straight or curly will depend on the cross-sectional shape of hair. Round hair grows straight out of the skin. The more oval-shaped the cross-section is, the curlier the hair will be.

The color of the hair is determined by the amount of melanin in the hardened cells. This can vary a lot from person to person, and it changes over the course of a lifetime. The amount of melanin typically decreases as people get older, and more air gets trapped inside the hair – it then loses its color and turns white. Depending on someone’s original hair color and the number of white hairs that grow, the hair on their head then turns gray or white.

Hair growth cycle

As long as new hair cells continue to grow in the hair bulb, the hair continues to grow longer. This growth phase is also called the anagen phase. At any point in time, about 90 percent of a person’s total amount of hair is in this growth phase.

Depending on where on the body a hair grows, the growth phase will last longer or shorter: For instance, the growth phase of hair on your head can last several years,, so it can grow to over a meter in length if you don’t have it cut. The growth phase is especially short for eyelashes, eyebrows, nasal hair and ear hair. Those hairs only grow for about 100 to 150 days, so they can’t get that long.

At the end of the growth phase, the hair root separates from the papilla. Then a transitional phase called the catagen phase starts, lasting about two to four weeks. When the hair has separated completely from the papilla, the supply of blood is cut off in the final resting phase, which is also called the telogen phase. The hair is gradually pushed out of the skin and eventually falls out. The resting phase can last several months.

New hair cells then start to multiply at the base of the “empty” hair follicle to form a new hair, and the growth phase of the hair growth cycle starts all over again.

.

What causes hair fall?

Hair fall reasons are many. What's causing your hair fall can determine whether your hair:

Falls out gradually or abruptly
Thins
Can regrow on its own
Requires treatment to regrow
Needs immediate care to prevent permanent hair fall

Major hair fall reasons

Hair fall reasons due to Hereditary factors

Both men and women develop this type of hair fall, which is one of the most common hair fall reasons worldwide. In men, it’s called male pattern hair fall. Women get female pattern hair fall. Regardless of whether it develops in a man or women, the medical term is androgenic alopecia.

No matter which term you use, it means that you've inherited genes that cause your hair follicles (what each hair grows out of) to shrink and eventually stop growing hair. Shrinking can begin as early as your teens, but it usually starts later in life.

In women, the first noticeable sign of hereditary hair  fall is usually overall thinning or a widening part.

When a man has hereditary hair fall, the first sign is often a receding hairline or bald spot at the top of his head.

Is hair fall reversal possible?

Yes, treatment can help stop or slow hair fall. It may also help regrow hair. The earlier treatment is started, the better it works. Without treatment, you will continue to have hair fall

.

Hair fall reasons due to Age

With age another hair fall reason, most people notice some hair fall because hair growth slows. At some point, hair follicles stop growing hair, which causes the hair on our scalp to thin. Hair also starts to lose its color. A woman’s hairline naturally starts to recede.

Is it possible to reverse this type of hair fall?

Caught early, treatment helps some people regrow their hair.

.

Hair fall reasons due to Alopecia areata

Alopecia areata is another hair fall reason. It is a disease that develops when the body's immune system attacks hair follicles (what holds the hair in place), causing hair fall. You can lose hair anywhere on your body, including your scalp, inside your nose, and in your ears. Some people lose their eyelashes or eyebrows.

.

Is reversal of hair fall in this case possible?

Yes. If your hair fails to grow back on its own, treatment may help stimulate regrowth.

.

Hair fall reasons because of Cancer treatment

Another major cause out of the hair fall reasons these days is the western system of cancer treatment. If you receive chemotherapy or have radiation treatment to your head or neck, you may lose all (or most of) your hair within a few weeks of starting treatment.

.

Is reversal of hair fall possible?

Hair usually starts to regrow within months of finishing chemotherapy or radiation treatments to the head or neck. Our doctors at Pratha Ayurveda can offer medication to help hair grow back more quickly.

.

Is this type of hair fall preventable?

Wearing a cooling cap before, during, and after each chemotherapy session may help prevent hair loss.
Hair fall reasons because of childbirth, illness, or other stressors
A few months after giving birth, recovering from an illness, or having an operation, you may notice a lot more hairs in your brush or on your pillow. This can also happen after a stressful time in your life, such as a divorce or death of a loved one.

.

Is reversal of hair fall possible?

If the stress stops, your body will readjust and the excessive shedding will stop. When the shedding stops, most people see their hair regain its normal fullness within 6 to 9 months.

.

Hair fall reasons because of Haircare

Coloring , perming, or relaxing your hair, could be damaging your hair and be one of the most common hair fall reasons subsequently. Over time, this damage can lead to hair fall.

.

Is a reversal of hair fall possible?

You can change how you care for your hair, which can prevent hair fall. Once you damage a hair follicle, hair cannot grow from that follicle. Having many damaged hair follicles creates permanent bald spots.

.

Hair fall reasons due to hairstyle pulls on your scalp

If you often wear your hair tightly pulled back, the continual pulling can lead to permanent hair fall. The medical name for this condition is traction alopecia.

.

Is reversal of hair fall possible?

No. You can prevent hair loss by making some changes.

.

Hair fall reasons due to hormonal imbalance

One of the most common hair fall reasons of this imbalance is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It leads to cysts on a woman’s ovaries, along with other signs and symptoms, which can include hair fall. Stopping some types of birth control pills can cause a temporary hormonal imbalance. Women who develop a hormonal imbalance can develop thinning hair (or hair fall) on their scalp.

.

Is reversal of hair fall possible?

Treatment may help.

.

Hair fall reasons due to Scalp infection

A scalp infection can lead to scaly and sometimes inflamed areas on your scalp. You may see what look like small black dots on your scalp. These are actually stubs of hair. Some people develop a bald spot.

.

Is reversal of hair fall possible?

Yes, treatment can get rid of the infection. Once the infection clears, hair tends to grow.

.

Hair fall reasons due to Medication

A possible side effect of some medications is hair fall. If you think a medication is causing your hair fall, ask the doctor who prescribed it if hair fall is a possible side effect. It’s essential that you do not stop taking the medication before talking with one of our qualified doctors at Pratha Ayurveda. Abruptly stopping some medications can cause serious health problems.

.

Is reversal of hair fall possible?

Yes.

.

Hair fall reasons due to Scalp psoriasis

Many people who have plaque psoriasis develop psoriasis on their scalp at some point. This can lead to hair fall.

.

Is reversal of hair fall possible?

Hair tends to regrow once the scalp psoriasis clears, but this takes time. By following these dermatologists’ tips, you may be able to prevent hair loss.

.

Hair fall reasons due to pulling your hair

Some people pull on their hair, often to relieve stress. They may be unaware that they're pulling their hair. The medical term for this is trichotillomania.

.

Is reversal of hair fall possible?

If you haven't destroyed the hair follicles, yes. For your hair to regrow, you have to stop pulling it.

.

Hair fall reasons due to Scarring alopecia?

This condition develops when inflammation destroys hair follicles. Once destroyed, a hair follicle cannot grow hair. Diverse conditions can cause this. The medical name for this group of conditions is cicatricial alopecia.

.

Is reversal of hair fall possible?

Once a hair follicle is destroyed, it cannot regrow a hair. Catching this condition early can prevent further hair loss.

.

Hair fall reasons due to Friction?


People can develop hair fall where boots, socks, or tight clothing frequently rubs against their skin. The medical term for this is frictional alopecia.

.

Is reversal of hair fall possible?

Hair tends to regrow on its own when the rubbing stops.

.

Hair fall reasons due to Poison

Being slowly poisoned can lead to hair fall. Poisons that can cause hair fall include arsenic, thallium, mercury, and lithium. If you ingest a large amount of warfarin, which is found in rat poisons, it can also cause hair fall. Taking large amounts of vitamin A or selenium is also toxic and can be another hair fall reason.

.

Is reversal of hair fall possible?

Yes, hair tends to regrow when you are no longer exposed to the poison.

While many hair fall reasons can be treated successfully, the key to effective treatment is to find out what’s causing the hair fall. Without an accurate diagnosis, treatment is often ineffective.

.

Graying Hair

Some people consider graying as something that makes them look distinguished; for others, it's a reminder that they’re getting older. How ever you feel about it, gray or white is pretty much inevitable with age (if you’re fortunate enough to still have it in your later years).

Scientists have put a lot of effort into investigating the hair fall reasons alongwith graying, and they believe they’ve gotten to the root of the hair fall reasons and problems. It gets its color from a pigment called melanin, which is produced by melanocyte cells in the follicles. Researchers have discovered that melanocytes endure cumulative damage over the years, which eventually leaves them unable to produce melanin. Studies have cited DNA damage and a buildup of hydrogen peroxide in the follicles as possible causes of this disruption in melanin production. Without melanin, the new hair that grows in has no pigment, which makes it appear gray, white, or silver.

Some people start to go gray young — as early as their teens. When graying begins usually is determined by genes, so if your mother or father became gray early, you may, too. If you are one of those people who don’t find gray hair distinguished, you can easily cover your gray with one of the many different dyes available.

What are Allergies?

Allergy occurs when a person reacts to substances in the environment that are harmless to most people. These substances are known as allergens and are found in dust mites, pets, pollen, insects, ticks, moulds, foods and some medications.

Atopy is the genetic tendency to develop allergic diseases. When atopic people are exposed to allergens they can develop an immune reaction that leads to allergic inflammation. This can cause symptoms in the:

1. Nose and/or eyes, resulting in allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and/or conjunctivitis.
2. Skin resulting in eczema, or hives (urticaria).
3. Lungs resulting in asthma.

.

What happens when you have an allergic reaction?

When a person who is allergic to a particular allergen comes into contact with it, an allergic reaction occurs:

1. When the allergen (such as pollen) enters the body, it triggers an antibody response.
2. The antibodies attach themselves to mast cells.
3. When the pollen comes into contact with the antibodies, the mast cells respond by releasing
histamine.
4. When the release of histamine is due to an allergen, the resulting inflammation (redness and
swelling) is irritating and uncomfortable.
Similar reactions can occur to some chemicals and food additives. However if they do not involve the immune system, they are known as adverse reactions, not allergy.

.

Which areas of the body may be affected?

People experience different symptoms, depending on the allergen and where it enters the body. Allergic reactions can involve many parts of the body at the same time.

.

Nose, eyes, sinuses and throat

When allergens are breathed in, the release of histamine causes the lining of the nose to produce more mucus and become swollen and inflamed. It causes the nose to run and itch, and violent sneezing may occur. Eyes may start to water and people may get a sore throat.

.

Lungs and chest

Asthma can be triggered during an allergic reaction. When an allergen is breathed in, the lining of the passages in the lungs swells and makes breathing difficult. 

.

Stomach and bowel

Foods that commonly cause allergy include peanuts, seafood, dairy products and eggs. Cow's milk allergy in infants may occur and can cause eczema, asthma, colic and stomach upset. Some people cannot digest lactose (milk sugar). Lactose intolerance causes stomach upsets, but should not be confused with allergy.

.

Skin

Skin problems that can be triggered by allergy include atopic dermatitis (eczema) and urticaria (hives).

Life threatening allergic reactions require immediate treatment

Most allergic reactions are mild to moderate, and do not cause major problems. However, a small number of people may experience a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, which requires immediate life saving medication. Allergens which may cause anaphylaxis include foods, insects and medications. People with a severe allergy should have an ASCIA Action Plan for Anaphylaxis. 

Allergen avoidance or minimization relies on identifying the cause of the allergy and taking steps to reduce exposure to the allergen. For example, reducing dust mite in the home may help reduce symptoms in people who are allergic to mites. 

.

Types of Allergies

An allergy occurs when your body's immune system sees a certain substance as harmful. It reacts by causing an allergic reaction. Substances that cause allergic reactions are allergens.

There are many types of allergies. Some allergies are seasonal and others are year-round. Some allergies may be life-long.

It is important to work with your health care provider to create a plan to manage your allergy. Avoiding your allergens is the best way to prevent an allergic reaction.

.

Drug Allergy

True allergies to drugs (medicines) occur in only a small number of people. Most drug reactions are not allergic, but are side effects of the properties of the medicine. A diagnosis of the cause of the drug reaction is usually based only upon the patient’s history and symptoms. Sometimes skin testing for drug allergy is also done.

.

Food Allergy

There are different types of allergic reactions to foods. There are differences between IgE-mediated allergies, non-IgE mediated allergies and food intolerances.

.

Insect Allergy

Bees, wasps, hornets, yellow jackets and fire ants are the most common stinging insects that cause an allergic reaction.

Non-stinging insects can also cause allergic reactions. The most common are cockroaches and the insect-like dust mite. Allergies to these two insects may be the most common cause of year-round allergy and asthma.

.

Latex Allergy

A latex allergy is an allergic reaction to natural rubber latex. Natural rubber latex gloves, balloons, condoms and other natural rubber products contain latex. An allergy to latex can be a serious health risk.

.

Mold Allergy

Mold and mildew are fungi. Since fungi grow in so many places, both indoors and outdoors, allergic reactions can occur year round.

.

Pet Allergy

Allergies to pets with fur are common. It is important to know that an allergy-free (hypoallergenic) breed of dog or cat does not exist.

.

Pollen Allergy

Pollen is one of the most common triggers of seasonal allergies. Many people know pollen allergy as “hay fever,” but experts usually refer to it as “seasonal allergic rhinitis.”''',

The 8 Most Common Types of Respiratory Disease

Many types of lung diseases can cause chronic respiratory conditions. Chronic respiratory disease affects millions of people in the United States alone. It can be difficult to say how many people have lung diseases overall because these diseases are grouped into specific conditions.

Many genetic and environmental factors can lead to lung disease, but smoking is the top preventable cause of many respiratory conditions.

This article will look at the eight most common respiratory diseases, their symptoms, and what causes them.

.

Asthma

Asthma affects 25 million people in the United States. People with a family history of asthma, respiratory allergies, or severe childhood respiratory illness are at a higher risk of developing asthma.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes breathing problems when the airways become narrowed by inflammation or blocked by mucus. The condition’s severity varies from person to person, but most people take daily preventive medication to control their symptoms and prevent flare-ups.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an umbrella term used to describe two primary types of obstructive lung disease that used to be classified separately: emphysema and chronic bronchitis.

•  Emphysema develops when the tiny air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) become damaged and less elastic. This reduces the ability of the sacs to move oxygen and other gases between the air that is breathed in and the blood. This can lead to a lack of oxygen in the blood (hypoxia) and a buildup of toxic waste products.

•  Chronic bronchitis is a condition where the lining of the bronchial tubes becomes irritated and inflamed. The swelling can make it more difficult to breathe and cause an overproduction of mucus.

Nearly 15 million people have been diagnosed with COPD in the United States, and another 12 million are believed to have the disease but do not have an official diagnosis.

COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. About eight in 10 cases are linked to exposure to cigarette smoke.

.

Cystic Fibrosis

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic condition that affects about 35,000 people in the United States. It can cause both breathing and digestive problems because the disease makes the mucus in the body very thick.

While the disease can involve several organs, it tends to cause specific problems in the lungs, such as blockages from thick mucus that trap harmful bacteria and lead to infections.

.

Lung Cancer

Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. It can develop as either small cell lung cancer or non-small cell lung cancer, which is the more common of the two.

Cigarette smoking—both direct and secondhand—is one of the biggest risk factors for lung cancer.

.

Tuberculosis

Tuberculosis is a bacterial lung disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. More than 1.8 billion people around the world have tuberculosis, but the disease is only considered active in 10 million of them.

It can also spread and cause damage to other parts of the body.

.

Bronchitis

Bronchitis is a condition that develops when the windpipe (bronchial tube) gets irritated or inflamed. In response to the inflammation, the lining of the bronchial tube may make too much mucus as it tries to coat the area. The mucus can make it difficult to breath.

Inflammation can also cause swelling of the airway. This will cause it to narrow and makes it harder to breathe.

.

Pneumonia

Pneumonia is a generic diagnosis. Even though there are different types of pneumonia, the way that the condition affects the lungs is similar in each one.

With pneumonia, a virus, bacteria, or another infectious agent causes the tiny air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) to fill with fluid or pus. These air sacs are what help exchange oxygen and other gases between the air that is breathed in and the blood. When these sacs are filled with fluid, the body’s ability to exchange gases is reduced.

.

Emphysema

Emphysema is a type of COPD that occurs when the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs lose their elasticity. These sacs are made to inflate and shrink and stretch with each breath, which allows air to move in and out of them.

If you have emphysema, these sacs have been damaged and cannot stretch when you breathe. As these air sacs become damaged and die off, your lungs have fewer working parts to move oxygen from the air you breathe into your blood.''',

   description:'''
PILES

Piles are swellings that develop inside and around the back passage (anal canal). There is a network of small veins (blood vessels) within the lining of the anal canal. These veins sometimes become wider and engorged with more blood than usual. The engorged veins and the overlying tissue may then form into one or more swellings (piles). Piles often don’t cause any problems but can cause bleeding and sometimes pain. If they do cause any bleeding or pain then you should see a doctor.

Piles can be divided into either internal or external piles. Some people develop internal and external piles at the same time.

Internal piles are deeper and initially form above a point 2-3 cm inside the back passage (anal canal) in the upper part of the anal canal or lower rectum (the last part of the large bowel that connects to the anal canal).

External piles start off nearer the surface, below a point 2-3 cm inside the back passage.

Despite the name, external piles aren't always seen outside of the opening of the back passage (anus). Equally confusing, internal piles can enlarge and drop down (prolapse), so that they hang outside of the anus.

Piles are also graded by their size and severity.

Piles symptoms can vary depending on the size, position and grade of the piles.

Grade 1 are small swellings on the inside lining of the anal canal. They cannot be seen or felt from outside the opening of the back passage (anus). Grade 1 piles are common. In some people they enlarge further to grade 2 or more.

Grade 2 are larger. They may be partly pushed out from the anus when you go to the toilet, but quickly spring back inside again.

Grade 3 hang out from the anus when you go to the toilet. You may feel one or more as small, soft lumps that hang from the anus. However, you can push them back inside the anus with a finger.

Grade 4 permanently hang down from within the anus, and you cannot push them back inside. They sometimes become quite large.

A possible complication of piles that hang down is that they can ‘strangulate’. This means that the blood supply to the pile has been cut off. A blood clot (thrombosis) can form within the pile. This causes really severe pain if it occurs. The pain usually reaches a peak after 48-72 hours and then gradually goes away over 7-10 days.

.

FISSURE

An anal fissure is a tear in the lining of the anus or anal canal (the opening through which stool passes out of the body). The fissure can be painful and may bleed.

Anal fissures can occur in anyone at any age. The chance of having an anal fissure decreases as people get older. People who have had fissures in the past are more likely to have them in the future.

.

What causes an anal fissure?

Anal fissures can be caused by trauma to the anus and anal canal. The trauma can be caused by one or more of the following:

1. Chronic (long-term) constipation
2. Straining to have a bowel movement, especially if the stool is large, hard and/or dry
3. Prolonged diarrhea
4. Anal sex, anal stretching
5. Insertion of foreign objects into the anus

Causes other than trauma include:

1. Longstanding poor bowel habits
2. Overly tight or spastic anal sphincter muscles (muscles that control the closing of the anus)
3. Scarring in the anorectal area
4. An underlying medical problem, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (types of inflammatory bowel disease); anal cancer; leukemia; infectious diseases (such as tuberculosis); and sexually transmitted diseases (such as syphilis, gonorrhea, Chlamydia, chancroid, HIV)
5. Decreased blood flow to the anorectal area

Anal fissures are also common in young infants and in women after childbirth.

Signs and symptoms of an anal fissure include:

1. Pain during, and even hours after, a bowel movement
2. Constipation
3. Blood on the outside surface of the stool
4. Blood on toilet tissue or wipes
5. A visible crack or tear in the anus or anal canal
6. Burning and itching that may be painful
7. Discomfort when urinating, frequent urination, or inability to urinate
8. Foul-smelling discharge

.

FISTULA

An anal fistula is a small tunnel that connects an abscess, an infected cavity in the anus, to an opening on the skin around the anus.

The anus is the external opening through which feces are expelled from the body. Just inside the anus are a number of small glands that make mucus. Occasionally, these glands get clogged and can become infected, leading to an abscess. About half of these abscesses may develop into a fistula.

The leading causes of an anal fistula are clogged anal glands and anal abscesses. Other, much less common, conditions that can cause an anal fistula include:

1. Crohn's disease (an inflammatory disease of the intestine)
2. Radiation (treatment for cancer)
3. Trauma
4. Sexually transmitted diseases
5. Tuberculosis
6. Diverticulitis (a disease in which small pouches form in the large intestine and become inflamed)
7. Cancer
The signs and symptoms of an anal fistula include:

1. Frequent anal abscesses
2. Pain and swelling around the anus
3. Bloody or foul-smelling drainage (pus) from an opening around the anus. The pain may decrease after the fistula

.
4. Irritation of the skin around the anus from drainage
5. Pain with bowel movements
6. Bleeding
7. Fever, chills and a general feeling of fatigue

There are more than 100 different gastric/liver diseases.
They have different causes, including:

•  Infection

•  Too much alcohol

•  Medications, illegal drugs, or toxins

•  Obesity

•  Cancer

Even though there are different diseases and different causes, many liver conditions damage the liver in similar ways. Because of this, they can look similar and cause similar symptoms.

Sometimes liver damage or even failure and related symptoms will be acute, or come on quickly. This can happen if you take too much acetaminophen or other medicines. Herbal supplements, viruses, and autoimmune conditions also can cause this. But most of the time, liver diseases and failure are chronic. This means they happen gradually as the liver is damaged slowly over time. In this case, symptoms can come on more gradually too.

.

Early Symptoms

You might not notice early symptoms. If you do, it might be hard to know what’s causing them. That’s because early signs of liver trouble are vague, like:

•  Belly pain

•  Not feeling hungry

•  Tiredness or lack of energy

•  Diarrhea

You may just feel generally sick or unwell and not know why.

.

Yellow Skin or Eyes (Jaundice)

As the organ gets more damaged, you may notice clearer signs of a problem. Your skin may look yellow along with the whites of your eyes. Doctors call this jaundice. This happens when too much of a yellow substance from your red blood cells called bilirubin builds up. Normally, your liver would clear the bilirubin out. But a damaged liver can’t keep up, so levels rise.

.

Itchy Skin

If you have lasting problems, you may feel itchy. This happens even though you don’t have a rash or anything on your skin. The itchiness can make it hard to do things like sleep. It keeps up even if you scratch. If you have this, ask your doctor if there’s medicine that can help.

.

Swollen Belly (Ascites)

If your organ is scarred, it can block blood flow to your liver and raise the pressure in blood vessels around it. This makes fluid seep out and collect in your belly. There may be a little fluid and swelling or a lot. Your belly may get very large and your belly button might push out. Sometimes ascites gets infected and needs antibiotics. If there’s a lot of extra fluid with nowhere to go, you may need to have it drained with a tube.

.

Swollen Legs or Ankles

In some people with ascites, legs and ankles also swell as fluid builds up. It might help to eat less salt or take medicine that makes you pee more.

.

Pale Poop and Dark Pee

Your organ is the reason that healthy poop looks brown. The brown color comes from bile salts made by your liver. If your organ doesn’t make bile normally or if the flow from the liver is blocked, your poop will look pale like the color of clay. Pale poop often happens along with yellow skin (jaundice). The extra bilirubin that makes your skin look yellow also can make your pee unusually dark.

.

Fatigue and Confusion

Many people with liver disease suffer from lingering fatigue. This might happen because of toxins building up since your organ isn’t clearing them like it should. The buildup of toxins in your body and bloodstream also can affect brain function. You might get confused or find it hard to concentrate. You might forget things or notice other changes as liver disease affects your brain.

.

Nausea and Vomiting

Your stomach might get upset early on if you have the disease. As the disease and damage to your organ go on, raised toxin levels can make this worse. Lingering nausea or throwing up often are a sign of problems. If your organ is failing, you also may have blood in your vomit or poop.

.

Bruising Easily or Bleeding

If your organ is failing, you may notice you get bruises more easily. If you get a cut or nosebleed, it may not stop like it should. While people with advanced liver disease are prone to bleeding, they also are more likely to get blood clots.

.

Red Palms and ‘Spider Webs’

You may have red marks from blood vessels under your skin that look like spider webs. Doctors call these spider naevi. They often happen on the cheeks, nose, and neck. One study in people who were alcoholics found that these are a strong indicator of liver problems. People with these spider-like marks also often have reddened palms (palmar erythema). Blotchy red palms are another symptom of advanced liver disease.

.

Catching Liver Disease Sooner

It’s possible you could have liver disease without knowing it. Lots of people with liver problems don’t seem sick. As damage to the organ gets worse, symptoms will start. If the damage has gone too far, there might not be any way to fix it. But knowing what to look for could help to catch liver problems early. That way you’ll have a chance to stop more damage and let your organ heal before it’s too late.''',

Sexual dysfunction refers to a challenge that occurs during any stage of sexual activity. This may be a problem that affects the desire for a partner, arousal, penetration, the act of sex itself, or achieving orgasm during intimacy.

While sexual dysfunctions are common in both men and women, intimacy challenges are experienced in ways that are unique to each sex.

Sleep is a necessary human function — it allows our brains to recharge and our bodies to rest. When we do not sleep long or well enough, our bodies do not get the full benefits of sleep, such as muscle repair and memory consolidation. Sleep is so crucial that even slight sleep deprivation or poor sleep can affect memory, judgment and mood. In addition to feelings of listlessness, chronic sleep deprivation can contribute to health problems, from obesity and high blood pressure to safety risks while driving.

What are autoimmune diseases?

Autoimmune diseases is a condition in which your immune system mistakenly attacks your body.

Normally, the immune system can tell the difference between foreign cells and your own cells.

In an autoimmune disease, the immune system mistakes part of your body, like your joints or skin, as foreign. It releases proteins called autoantibodies that attack healthy cells.

Some autoimmune diseases target only one organ. Type 1 diabetes damages the pancreas. Other diseases, like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), affect the whole body.

.

Top of Form

Autoimmune disease symptoms

The early symptoms of many autoimmune diseases are very similar, such as:

•  fatigue
•  achy muscles
•  swelling and redness
•  low-grade fever
•  trouble concentrating
•  numbness and tingling in the hands and feet
•  hair loss
•  skin rashes

Individual diseases can also have their own unique symptoms. For example, type 1 diabetes causes extreme thirst, weight loss, and fatigue. IBD causes belly pain, bloating, and diarrhea.

With autoimmune diseases like psoriasis or RA, symptoms may come and go. A period of symptoms is called a flare-up. A period when the symptoms go away is called remission.

.

14 common autoimmune diseases

There are more than 80 different autoimmune diseases. Here are 14 of the most common ones.

.

1. Type 1 diabetes

The pancreas produces the hormone insulin, which helps regulate blood sugar levels. In type 1 diabetes mellitus, the immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.

High blood sugar results can lead to damage in the blood vessels, as well as organs like the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves.

.

2. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the immune system attacks the joints. This attack causes redness, warmth, soreness, and stiffness in the joints.

Unlike osteoarthritis, which commonly affects people as they get older, RA can start as early as your 30s or sooner.

.

3. Psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis

Skin cells normally grow and then shed when they're no longer needed. Psoriasis causes skin cells to multiply too quickly. The extra cells build up and form inflamed red patches, commonly with silver-white scales of plaque on the skin.

Up to 30 percent of people with psoriasis also develop swelling, stiffness, and pain in their joints. This form of the disease is called psoriatic arthritis.

.

4. Multiple sclerosis

Multiple sclerosis (MS) damages the myelin sheath, the protective coating that surrounds nerve cells, in your central nervous system. Damage to the myelin sheath slows the transmission speed of messages between your brain and spinal cord to and from the rest of your body.

This damage can lead to symptoms like numbness, weakness, balance issues, and trouble walking. The disease comes in several forms that progress at different rates. According to a 2012 studyTrusted Source, about 50 percent of people with MS need help walking within 15 years after the disease starts.

.

5. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

Although doctors in the 1800s first described lupus as a skin disease because of the rash it commonly produces, the systemic form, which is most the common, actually affects many organs, including the joints, kidneys, brain, and heart.

Joint pain, fatigue, and rashes are among the most common symptoms.

.

6. Inflammatory bowel disease

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a term used to describe conditions that cause inflammation in the lining of the intestinal wall. Each type of IBD affects a different part of the GI tract.

Crohn's disease can inflame any part of the GI tract, from the mouth to the anus.
Ulcerative colitis affects only the lining of the large intestine (colon) and rectum.

.

7. Addison's disease

Addison's disease affects the adrenal glands, which produce the hormones cortisol and aldosterone as well as androgen hormones. Having too little of cortisol can affect the way the body uses and stores carbohydrates and sugar (glucose). Deficiency of aldosterone will lead to sodium loss and excess potassium in the bloodstream.

Symptoms include weakness, fatigue, weight loss, and low blood sugar.

.

8. Graves' disease

Graves' disease attacks the thyroid gland in the neck, causing it to produce too much of its hormones. Thyroid hormones control the body's energy usage, known as metabolism.

Having too much of these hormones revs up your body's activities, causing symptoms like nervousness, a fast heartbeat, heat intolerance, and weight loss.

One potential symptom of this disease is bulging eyes, called exophthalmos. It can occur as a part of what is called Graves' ophthalmopathy, which occurs in around 30 percent of those who have Graves' disease, according to a 1993 studyTrusted

.

9. Sjögren's syndrome

This condition attacks the glands that provide lubrication to the eyes and mouth. The hallmark symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome are dry eyes and dry mouth, but it may also affect the joints or skin.

.

10. Hashimoto's thyroiditis

In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, thyroid hormone production slows to a deficiency. Symptoms include weight gain, sensitivity to cold, fatigue, hair loss, and swelling of the thyroid (goiter).

.

11. Myasthenia gravis

Myasthenia gravis affects nerve impulses that help the brain control the muscles. When the communication from nerves to muscles is impaired, signals can't direct the muscles to contract.

The most common symptom is muscle weakness that gets worse with activity and improves with rest. Often muscles that control eye movements, eyelid opening, swallowing, and facial movements are involved.

.

12. Autoimmune vasculitis

Autoimmune vasculitis happens when the immune system attacks blood vessels. The inflammation that results narrows the arteries and veins, allowing less blood to flow through them.

.

13. Pernicious anemia

This condition causes deficiency of a protein, made by stomach lining cells, known as intrinsic factor that is needed in order for the small intestine to absorb vitamin B-12 from food. Without enough of this vitamin, one will develop an anemia, and the body's ability for proper DNA synthesis will be altered.

Pernicious anemia is more common in older adults. According to a 2012 study, it affects 0.1 percent of people in general, but nearly 2 percent of people over age 60.

.

14. Celiac disease

People with celiac disease can't eat foods containing gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and other grain products. When gluten is in the small intestine, the immune system attacks this part of the gastrointestinal tract and causes inflammation.

A 2015 studyTrusted Source noted that celiac disease affects about 1 percent of people in the United States. A larger number of people have reported gluten sensitivity, which isn't an autoimmune disease, but can have similar symptoms like diarrhea and abdominal pain.''',

What is a joint?

A joint is a point where bones make contact, connecting the skeletal system. Most joints are mobile, which allows the body to make different types of movement. There are three kinds of joint: fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial.

Fibrous joints are usually immovable. They include the cranium in the skull, the joints between the teeth and the sockets in the jaw, and the joints between the bones of the lower leg.

Cartilaginous joints are those where cartilage joins two bones. These joints are partially movable. One example is the joint between the right and left pubic bone.

Synovial joints are the joints that allow limbs to move freely. These joints have a cavity in them that contains synovial fluid. This fluid allows the bones that connect the joint to move around with ease. Some examples include the knee, elbow, hip, and shoulder.

Joint Pain

Joints are the parts of your body where your bones meet. Joints allow the bones of your skeleton to move. Joints include:

•  shoulders
•  hips
•  elbows
•  knees
Joint pain refers to discomfort, aches, and soreness in any of the body’s joints. Joint pain is a common complaint. It doesn’t typically require a hospital visit. Sometimes, joint pain is the result of an illness or injury. Arthritis is also a common cause of joint pain. However, it can also be due to other conditions or factors.

.

What causes joint pain?

Many conditions and factors can cause a person to experience joint pain. If a person has pain in multiple joints, it is known as polyarthralgia. Usually, joint pain is the result of injury, infection, illness, or inflammation.

Below are some of the common causes of joint pain:

.

Injury

Injury is a common cause of joint pain. Injuries can result from the excessive use or effort of the joints or from an impact that causes a fracture, sprain, or strain.

For example, a common knee injury is damage to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). People who play certain sports, such as soccer, basketball, or football, are more at risk of injuring their ACL.

.

Viral infection

Some infections may result in joint pain. For example, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) can cause complications that result in joint pain. It is common for people with HCV to have related rheumatic diseases, which can cause problems, including joint pain.

.

Disease

Some diseases can cause joint pain. Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease, and common symptoms include muscle and joint pain. In fact, joint pain is the first symptom for more than half of those who develop lupus.

People develop lupus because their body’s immune system becomes hyperactive and attacks normal, healthy tissue.

.

Arthritis

One of the most common causes of joint pain is arthritis. The two main forms of arthritis are osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

OA is most common in adults over age 40. It progresses slowly and tends to affect commonly used joints like the:

•  wrists
•  hands
•  hips
•  knees
Joint pain due to OA results from a breakdown of the cartilage that serves as a cushion and shock absorber for the joints.

The second form of arthritis is RA. It more commonly affects women than men.

It can deform and debilitate the joints over time. RA causes pain, inflammation, and fluid buildup in the joints as the body’s immune system attacks the membrane that lines the joints.

.

Other causes of Joint Pain

Joint pain can be caused by:

•  bursitis, or inflammation of the cushioning pads around joints
•  lupus
•  gout
•  certain infectious diseases, such as mumps, influenza, and hepatitis
•  chondromalacia of the patella, or a breakdown of the cartilage in the kneecap
•  an injury
•  tendinitis, or inflammation of the tendon
•  an infection of the bone or joint
•  overuse of a joint
•  cancer
•  fibromyalgia
•  osteoporosis
•  sarcoidosis
•  rickets

According to Ayurveda, joint pain occurs due to the imbalance in the functional energy or Dosha in the body, known as Vata. This energy is responsible for movement and spaces, which corresponds to the space between the joints. An imbalance in a form of Vata known as Vyanavata can cause circulation problems.

As a result, the tissues fail to get nourishment. This leads to wear and tear causing severe joint pain. One more form of energy is the Shleshaka Kapha. This helps keep the joints lubricated allowing for smooth movement.

Imbalance in the Doshas causes the weakening of the digestive fire. This causes the accumulation of toxins. The toxins are carried to the joints by Vata and they also cause joint pain. The Shleshaka Kapha gets dried up due to the presence of toxins. This affects the lubrication in the joints causing joint pain.

Ayurveda believes that to help manage joint pain, helping to maintain the Dosha is necessary. This can be done through the help of therapies, helping to make dietary and lifestyle changes, and using Ayurvedic herbal supplements.

.

What are the symptoms of joint pain?

In some cases, your joint pain will require you to see a doctor. You should make an appointment if you don’t know the cause of your joint pain and are experiencing other unexplained symptoms.

You should also see a doctor if:

•  the area around the joint is swollen, red, tender, or warm to the touch
•  the joint pain persists for three days or more
•  you have a fever but no other signs of the flu

Go to the emergency room if any of the following occurs:

•  You’ve experienced a serious injury.
•  The joint appears deformed.
•  Swelling of the joint occurs suddenly.
•  The joint is completely immobile.
•  You have severe joint pain.

.

How is joint pain diagnosed?

Our doctor will probably perform an exam on the call. They’ll also ask you a series of questions about your joint pain. This may help to narrow down the potential causes.

A joint X-ray may be necessary to identify arthritis-related joint damage to access the gravity of the pain.

If your doctor suspects there’s another cause, they may order a blood test to screen for certain autoimmune disorders. They may also request a sedimentation rate test to measure the level of inflammation in the body or a complete blood count.

.

What is the outlook for people with joint pain?

Joint pain is often a result of the damage that occurs through normal wear and tear. However, it can also be a sign of an infection or potentially debilitating RA.

You should see your doctor if you have any unexplained joint pain, especially if it doesn’t go away on its own after a few days. Early detection and diagnosis can allow for effective treatment of the underlying cause of your discomfort.

.

Why joints pain

Joint Pain can have many different causes. For many people, joint pain is caused by arthritis, a group of conditions marked by inflammation in the joints.

Osteoarthritis has been affecting more than 15 million adults annually, with India contributing 22% to 39% share to the global numbers.Osteoarthritis can typically affect hands, hips, and knees. After this, the other common joint pain conditions affecting Indians are gout and rheumatoid arthritis.

In India, severe vitamin D deficiency, obesity and poor nutrition make women more susceptible to arthritis. As a result of this, the average age for the onset of knee problems is 50 years among Indian women while it is 60 years for men.

Even in general, women are twofold more prone to arthritis than men.

For others, joint pain may be caused by an injury or infection of the joints, or another condition, such as fibromyalgia or even depression. It can also be the result of poor posture or long periods of inactivity.

It’s possible for people with arthritis to help their symptoms, but many don’t know how. Treating joint pain isn’t always as simple as taking a pill or doing a few exercises, but ignoring the pain won’t make it go away.

Fortunately, there are many available treatment options that you can try. Depending on the cause and severity of your joint pain, you can find the combination of treatments that work for you.

.

Home remedies

Many causes of joint pain can be managed at home with a few lifestyle changes.

Hot and cold therapy

To reduce stiffness in the joints, try alternating cold with hot treatments. Warm showers or baths may help lessen stiffness in your joints in the morning. At night, you can try sleeping with an electric heated blanket or a heating pad.

Cold treatment is also helpful for relieving inflammation in the joints. Wrap a gel ice pack in a towel and apply it to painful joints for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day.

.

Diet changes

Eating a diet rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables might reduce the symptoms of arthritis.

Research suggests that a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants can help prevent inflammation. These foods include:

• omega-3-rich foods, such as walnuts, chia seeds, flaxseed, and fatty fish like salmon, tuna, and mackerel
• antioxidant-rich foods, such as colorful fruits and vegetables, beans, nuts, red wine, and dark chocolate

On top of including more of these foods in your diet, be sure to also cut out processed carbohydrates and saturated or trans fats.

.

Exercise

Physical activity, such as walking or swimming, can not only decrease pain, but also improve your mood and quality of life. The CDC suggests that people with arthritis should try to get at least 150 minutes of physical activity each week.

Make sure to avoid activities that are more likely to cause joint injuries, such as high-impact exercises like tennis or running.

Yoga is an excellent activity for people with joint pain.

If you’re overweight, you can reduce joint pain and arthritis symptoms by maintaining a healthy weight. Added weight puts more pressure on your joints, particularly your knees, hips, and feet.

If you’re having trouble losing weight, our doctor can to get you started on your weight loss journey.

.

Supplements

Dietary supplements may help to relieve symptoms such as inflammation and joint pain. No dietary supplement has shown clear-cut benefits for joint pain, but there’s some evidence a few supplements might help.

Examples include:

•  fish oil, which has been shown to help to relieve tender joints and morning stiffness in people with RA
•  ginger, which has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect in laboratory studies and to reduce pain and disability in people with OA
•  glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate could be helpful for people with moderate-to-severe knee pain

Keep in mind that if your joint pain is being caused by another condition, such as RA, home remedies like supplements should never replace medical treatment.

.

Ayurvedic Treatment for Relief from Joint Pain

The science of life, Ayurveda, holds all the secrets to various health concerns and cures for the human body.

The ancient knowledge of Ayurveda is based on the foundations of harmony and balance within the human body and between the body and its surrounding environment. According to Ayurveda, our body is a harmonious amalgamation of different parts that co-exist together, enabling us to participate in our day-to-day functioning.

Our joints are the connections between two bones that facilitate this movement in our body. However, there are several factors that can cause severe problems and damage to our joints, resulting in the commonly found concern of joint pain, which can have a direct impact on our motion.

.

Common Preventions for Joint Care

There is a reason why the phrase ‘Prevention is better than cure’ is vital in healthcare. The all-encompassing knowledge of Ayurveda has been incorporating this vision since ancient times. Nidana Parivarjana (avoidance of causative factors) is an ayurvedic term viewed as the initial footmark for any disease. Therefore, incorporating preventive measures into our daily routine or dinacharya is a foolproof method of ensuring holistic health and wellbeing. 

Ayurveda offers a wide range of solutions and lifestyle practices on how to prevent joint pain. Adopting healthy habits such as regular exercise, avoiding tobacco products, intaking a balanced diet, and maintaining a healthy body weight can help avoid joint pain and related concerns. Along with this, one should be careful while performing strenuous physical activities such as working out and lifting heavy objects.

They add further pressure on weight-bearing joints, which can result in injuries or straining. Other than these everyday activities, one should also incorporate ayurvedic herbal remedies and ingredients in their diets or separately for daily consumption in the form of tablets, capsules, herbal teas, or powders.

Finally, one should regularly perform abhyanga massages with ayurvedic oils to ensure joint flexibility, stability, and smooth movement of joints.

.

Ayurvedic Medicines for Joint Pain and Care

Whether chronic or mild, joint pain is a health concern faced by millions of people across the globe. It may start as a mild pain that gets easily sidelined and is ignored but can quickly turn into a chronic disorder. Therefore, we must take the proper care and measures to ensure our joints’ health and smooth functioning. Incorporating natural home remedies and practices in our daily lifestyles is one of the best ways to take care of our joints.

Ayurveda offers a plethora of natural remedies and herbal blends for joint pain and care. 

1. Turmeric(Curcuma Longa)-

Turmeric or Haldi is a bright yellow spice that is often used in Ayurvedic remedies. Curcumin in turmeric has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties that can significantly reduce joint pain. Turmeric is widely used in cooking in a lot of South Asian countries. Its anti-inflammatory properties are significantly helpful for people with rheumatoid arthritis, in which the body’s immune system starts attacking itself, leading to inflammation and pain in the joints.

It also improves joint flexibility and support thus is highly effective for knee pain too. Knee pain is one of the most common joint pains people suffer as it is a weight-bearing joint in our body. Turmeric can either be consumed as a spice in the form of turmeric powder or as a supplement in the form of capsules or joint care ayurvedic tablets. 

.

2. Ginger(Zingiber officinale)-

Ginger, another commonly found and used spice, can significantly improve joint pain. A 2001 study by R D Altman and KC Marcussen shows that ginger extract had a statistically significant effect on reducing symptoms of Osteoarthritis of the knee. Like turmeric, ginger also has anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce joint pain and improve joint health simultaneously. Regular consumption of these spices can help reduce the humiliation of ama in the joints, thereby restoring the optimal levels of the Vata Dosha. Ginger is a popular and natural herbal remedy that can be consumed as a spice, natural extract, herbal tea or capsules. It is a widely available spice that tackles the inflammatory response initiated by joint pain and significantly reduces aches. 

.

3. Ayurvedic oils for joints-

Ayurvedic oils have been used for centuries for their therapeutic properties. Abhyanga, oil massages on the entire body with warm oil calm the body and the mind while significantly reducing bodily pains. 

.

4. Dashmula

Dashmula or ‘ten roots’ is a herbal mixture of ten tree and shrub roots such as Patala, Gambhaari, Brihati, Shalparni, Shyonaak, Gokharu, Kantkaari, Agnimanth, Bilva, and Prishniparni. This herbal remedy can combat symptoms of arthritis such as swelling and pain. It has an analgesic, antioxidant, and painkiller effect on arthritis symptoms such as swelling and joint pain. Its anti-inflammatory properties can combat inflammation in joints, which is a common ill-effect of rheumatoid arthritis. It also acts as an antioxidant, analgesic, and sedative to help improve digestion, nerve related health concerns and reduce muscle spasms. Dashamula can be used in the form of ayurvedic massage oil or can be consumed as a powder.

Neurological Conditions and Symptoms You Should Should be Careful of
      
The nervous system is a complex, highly specialized network. From sight to smell and walking to speaking, our nervous system organizes, explains and connects us to the world around us.

“Our nervous systems are composed of some of the most important parts of our body: the brain, the spinal cord, muscles and the nerves that connect them,” said Christina Chrisman, MD, a neuromuscular neurologist at Banner – University Medical Center Phoenix. “They are responsible for many important functions in our bodies, such as memory, perception, language, movement, swallowing, breathing and even bowel and bladder function.”

When something goes wrong with a part of the nervous system, however, it can cause a neurological disorder. Neurological disorders affect millions of people each year, yet many people may be unaware they have one.

Understanding symptoms of neurological disorders is important, as it can lead you to an appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Here are six common neurological disorders and ways to identify each one.

.

1. Headaches

Headaches are one of the most common neurological disorders and can affect anyone at any age. While many times a headache shouldn't be anything too serious to worry about, if your headache comes on suddenly and repeatedly, you should see a doctor, as these could be symptoms of an underlying condition.

“The sudden onset of severe headache as well as headache associated with a fever, light sensitivity and stiff neck are all red flags of something more serious such as intracranial bleeding or meningitis,” Dr. Chrisman said. “If your headaches are happening often and you find yourself taking over-the-counter pain medication frequently, this is also an indication you need medical attention.”

Although headache disorders like tension-type headaches and migraines aren't life-threatening, dealing with chronic pain can be debilitating. There are many treatment options available today for headache disorders that can help you get back to a more normal life.

.

2. Epilepsy and Seizures

Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder involving abnormal electrical activity in the brain that makes you more susceptible to having recurrent, unprovoked seizures. “Unprovoked means the seizure cannot be explained by exposure to or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol, as well as not due to other medical issues such as severe electrolyte abnormalities or very high blood sugar,” Dr. Chrisman said.

The tricky part is that if you have one seizure in your life, it doesn't necessarily mean you have epilepsy. But, if you have two or more, it may be epilepsy. Seizure symptoms can vary depending on where in the brain the seizure is coming from. After experiencing a seizure, it's important to see your doctor. There are many effective treatments to manage epilepsy that can result in seizure-freedom, usually medication. “In the appropriate patient, treatment may include epilepsy surgery, which involves removing the seizure focus in the brain, and that can be curative,” Dr. Chrisman said.

.

3. Stroke

A stroke is usually due to a lack of blood flow to the brain, oftentimes caused by a clot or blockage in an artery. Many interventions can be done to stop a stroke these days, but time is brain (not money) in this case. The B.E. F.A.S.T. mnemonic is helpful to remember to recognize the signs of a stroke: B: Balance difficulties; E: Eyesight changes; F: Face weakness; A: Arm weakness; S: Speech; and T: Time. These signs and symptoms don't always mean someone is having a stroke, but it's very important to call 911 and get help right away, just to be sure.

.

4. ALS: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a somewhat rare neuromuscular condition that affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Doctors are unsure what exactly causes ALS, but factors that may cause ALS include genetics and environmental factors.

Symptoms include muscle weakness and twitching, tight and stiff muscles, slurred speech, and difficulty breathing and swallowing. Unfortunately, this condition is difficult to diagnose and often requires the evaluation of a neuromuscular neurologist.

“There is usually a delay in diagnosis for this condition of about one year, on average, by the time the patient gets to the neuromuscular specialist and receives the correct diagnosis,” Dr. Chrisman said. “Although there is no cure, there are treatments, and it’s important to start these as early as possible.”

.

5. Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia

Memory loss is a common complaint, especially in older adults. A certain degree of memory loss is a normal part of aging. For example, walking into a room and forgetting why may be totally normal.

However, there are signs that may indicate something more serious, such as dementia or Alzheimer's disease. These symptoms may include getting lost, having difficulty managing finances, difficulties with activities of daily living, leaving the stove on, forgetting the names of close family and friends or problems with language. Behavioral changes along with these memory changes could also raise concerns.

Dementia is a slowly progressive condition and should be evaluated by a neurologist. While there is no cure, there are medications and therapies that can help manage symptoms.

.

6. Parkinson's Disease

Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that primarily affects coordination.

Symptoms of Parkinson's disease usually get worse over time. You may experience changes in posture, walking and facial expressions early on in the disease, and cognitive and behavioral problems could develop later in the disease.

.

Seek Help Immediately

This can be especially important to rule out or confirm a stroke and for you to be eligible for potentially life-saving treatments.

Seizures are also quite serious, so it's important to seek prompt medical attention for a new onset of seizures and to be aware of safety restrictions, such as not operating heavy machinery, and precautions for your safety as well as the safety of others.

Otherwise, neurological disorders may be slowly progressive and require a specialist to diagnose. Neurology has many different sub-specialties, including neuromuscular disorders, movement disorders and headache.''',

What are the main causes of chronic kidney disease?

Diabetes and high blood pressure, or hypertension, are responsible for two-thirds of chronic kidney disease cases. 

Diabetes: Diabetes occurs when your blood sugar remains too high. Over time, unmanaged blood sugar can cause damage to many organs in your body, including the kidneys and heart and blood vessels, nerves, and eyes. 

High blood pressure: High blood pressure occurs when your blood pressure against the walls of your blood vessels increases. If uncontrolled or poorly controlled, high blood pressure can be a leading cause of heart attacks, strokes, and chronic kidney disease. Also, chronic kidney disease can cause high blood pressure.

.

Signs of Kidney Disease

You’re more tired, have less energy or are having trouble concentrating. A severe decrease in kidney function can lead to a buildup of toxins and impurities in the blood. This can cause people to feel tired, weak and can make it hard to concentrate. Another complication of kidney disease is anemia, which can cause weakness and fatigue.

You’re having trouble sleeping. When the kidneys aren’t filtering properly, toxins stay in the blood rather than leaving the body through the urine. This can make it difficult to sleep. There is also a link between obesity and chronic kidney disease, and sleep apnea is more common in those with chronic kidney disease, compared with the general population.

You have dry and itchy skin. Healthy kidneys do many important jobs. They remove wastes and extra fluid from your body, help make red blood cells, help keep bones strong and work to maintain the right amount of minerals in your blood. Dry and itchy skin can be a sign of the mineral and bone disease that often accompanies advanced kidney disease, when the kidneys are no longer able to keep the right balance of minerals and nutrients in your blood.

You feel the need to urinate more often. If you feel the need to urinate more often, especially at night, this can be a sign of kidney disease. When the kidneys filters are damaged, it can cause an increase in the urge to urinate. Sometimes this can also be a sign of a urinary infection or enlarged prostate in men.

You see blood in your urine. Healthy kidneys typically keep the blood cells in the body when filtering wastes from the blood to create urine, but when the kidney’s filters have been damaged, these blood cells can start to “leak” out into the urine. In addition to signaling kidney disease, blood in the urine can be indicative of tumors, kidney stones or an infection.

Your urine is foamy. Excessive bubbles in the urine – especially those that require you to flush several times before they go away—indicate protein in the urine. This foam may look like the foam you see when scrambling eggs, as the common protein found in urine, albumin, is the same protein that is found in eggs.

You’re experiencing persistent puffiness around your eyes. Protein in the urine is an early sign that the kidneys’ filters have been damaged, allowing protein to leak into the urine. This puffiness around your eyes can be due to the fact that your kidneys are leaking a large amount of protein in the urine, rather than keeping it in the body.

Your ankles and feet are swollen. Decreased kidney function can lead to sodium retention, causing swelling in your feet and ankles. Swelling in the lower extremities can also be a sign of heart disease, liver disease and chronic leg vein problems.

You have a poor appetite. This is a very general symptom, but a buildup of toxins resulting from reduced kidney function can be one of the causes.

Your muscles are cramping. Electrolyte imbalances can result from impaired kidney function. For example, low calcium levels and poorly controlled phosphorus may contribute to muscle cramping. ''',
